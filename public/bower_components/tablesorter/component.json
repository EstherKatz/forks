  "readme": "tablesorter is a jQuery plugin for turning a standard HTML table with THEAD and TBODY tags into a sortable table without page refreshes.\ntablesorter can successfully parse and sort many types of data including linked data in a cell.\n\n### [Documentation](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/)\n\n* See the [full documentation](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/).\n* All of the [original document pages](http://tablesorter.com/docs/) have been included.\n* Information from my blog post on [undocumented options](http://wowmotty.blogspot.com/2011/06/jquery-tablesorter-missing-docs.html) and lots of new demos have also been included.\n* Change log moved from included text file into the [wiki documentation](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki/Change).\n\n### Demos\n\n* [Basic alpha-numeric sort Demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/).\n* Links to demo pages can be found within the main [documentation](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/).\n* More demos & playgrounds - updated in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki).\n\n### Features\n\n* Multi-column alphanumeric sorting.\n* Multi-tbody sorting - see the [options](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/index.html#options) table on the main document page.\n* Parsers for sorting text, alphanumeric text, URIs, integers, currency, floats, IP addresses, dates (ISO, long and short formats) &amp; time. [Add your own easily](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers.html).\n* Support for ROWSPAN and COLSPAN on TH elements.\n* Support secondary \"hidden\" sorting (e.g., maintain alphabetical sort when sorting on other criteria).\n* Extensibility via [widget system](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widgets.html).\n* Cross-browser: IE 6.0+, FF 2+, Safari 2.0+, Opera 9.0+.\n* Small code size.\n* Works with jQuery 1.2.6+ (jQuery 1.4.1+ needed with some widgets).\n* Works with jQuery 1.9+ ($.browser.msie was removed; needed in the original version).\n\n### Licensing\n\n* Copyright (c) 2007 Christian Bach.\n* Original examples and docs at: [http://tablesorter.com](http://tablesorter.com).\n* Dual licensed under the [MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) licenses.\n\n### Special Thanks\n\n* Big shout-out to [Nick Craver](https://github.com/NickCraver) for getting rid of the `eval()` function that was previously needed for multi-column sorting.\n* Big thanks to [thezoggy](https://github.com/thezoggy) for helping with code, themes and providing valuable feedback.\n* Big thanks to [ThsSin-](https://github.com/TheSin-) for taking over for a while and also providing valuable feedback.\n* And, of course thanks to everyone else that has contributed, and continues to contribute to this forked project!\n\n### Change Log\n\nView the [complete listing here](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki/Change).\n\n#### <a name=\"v2.13.2\">Version 2.13.2</a> (11/2/2013)\n\n* Updated pager &amp; filter widget to work when the pager `countChildRows` option is `true`:\n  * Filter widget now properly added a \"filtered\" class to child rows\n  * Pager plugin & widget now properly calculate a correct total number of rows\n  * See [issue #396](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/396).\n* Updated editable widget to target table cell children if they exist\n  * This fixes the issue in IE where making a table element contenteditable is not allowed.\n  * See [issue #404](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/404) for further details.\n\n#### <a name=\"v2.13.1\">Version 2.13.1</a> (10/31/2013)\n\n* Fixed filter widget issues\n  * filter indexing will now be correct, even if a \"tablesorter-filter\" input/select doesn't exist in the filter row\n  * Already parsed filters (filter-formatter) will not attempt to reparse the value; problem was caused by parsed dates.\n\n#### <a name=\"v2.13\">Version 2.13</a> (10/30/2013)\n\n* Added a \"Development\" branch to the repository.\n  * I have started development on version 3 of tablesorter and this branch will have a basic structure to allow modularization of tablesorter.\n  * So far, only the tablesorter core has been restructured and reorganized.\n  * Added basic Zepto support to the core and some basic widgets, this is a work-in-progress. See [issue #398](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/398).\n\n* Ensure resized headers have stored data, or provide a fallback. Fixes [issue #394](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/394).\n* Added pager `countChildRows` option (plugin &amp; widget)\n  * When `true`, the pager treats child rows as if it were a parent row and strictly enforces showing only the set number of pager rows.\n  * This can cause problems as a child row may not appear associated with its parent, may be split across pages or possibly distort the table layout if the parent or child row contain row or cell spans.\n  * When `false` the pager always includes the child row with its parent, ignoring the set pager size.\n  * See [issue #396](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/396).\n* Removed triggered change event to fix [issue #400](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/400).\n* Merged in filter formatter fix for jQuery UI dateFormat conflict; [pull #403](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/403). Thanks @Craga89!\n\n* Grouping widget update\n  * Added `group_separator` option which is used when a `group-separator-#` class name is applied\n  * Updated [grouping widget demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-grouping.html).\n* Added a file-type parser\n  * Optimally used with the grouping widget to sort similar file types (e.g. video extensions: .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc)\n  * [File type sorting demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-file-type.html) added.\n* Updated LESS theme to work properly with LESS 4.1+\n* Other changes\n  * Improved `formatFloat()` replace method.\n  * Sorting a zero hex value (`0x00`) is now possible.\n\n#### <a name=\"v2.12\">Version 2.12</a> (10/18/2013)\n\n**Core**\n* Added `numberSorter` option allowing you to modify the overall numeric sorter.\n* Updated the `textSorter` option to allow setting a text sorter for each column.\n  * The `textSorter` functon parameters have changed from `(a, b, table, column)` to `(a, b, direction, column, table)`.\n  * Restructured &amp; combined sorting functions internally so that tablesorter will always sort empty cells no matter what sorting algorithm is used by the `textSorter`.\n  * Renamed `$.tablesorter.sortText()` to `$.tablesorter.sortNatural()`\n  * Added a new basic alphabetical sort algorithm `$.tablesorter.sortText = function(a, b) { return a > b ? 1 : (a < b ? -1 : 0); };` which can be set using the `textSorter` option.\n  * New examples can be found in the updated [custom sort demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-option-custom-sort.html).\n\n* Added `fixedUrl` option for use with the `$.tablesorter.storage()` function.\n  * Setting this with a fixed name (it doesn't need to be a url) allows saving table data (`saveSort` widget, `savePages` in pager widget) for tables on multiple pages in a domain.\n  * Additional storage options are described below under \"Storage\".\n* An accurate number of table columns is now contained within `table.config.columns`. This accounts for multiple header rows, tds, ths, etc.\n* Replaced `.innerHTML` with jQuery's `.html()` to fix issues in IE8. Fixes [issue #385](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/385).\n* Version numbers should now all be accurate, even in the comments.. at least this time ;). Fixes [issue #386](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/386).\n\n**Pager**\n* In attempts to initialize the pager after the filter widget:\n  * Added a pager widget (still beta testing) to allow initializing the pager after certain widgets (filter widget).\n  * Updated tablesorter core (properly count table columns) &amp; filter widget code to allow it to initialize on an empty table (thanks @stanislavprokopov!).\n  * Hopefully one or both of these changes fixes [issue #388](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/388).\n  * New pager widget demos: [basic](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-pager.html) & [ajax](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-pager-ajax.html).\n* `savePages` option\n  * Should no longer cause an error if stored data is malformed or unrecognized. Fixes [issue #387](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/387).\n  * The stored size and page is now cleared if the table is destroyed.\n* Fixed an error occuring in IE when trying to determine if a variable is an array (`toString` function call not recognized). Fixes [issue #390](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/390).\n* Updated pager rendering to prevent multiple ajax calls.\n* During this update, the pager page size would return as zero and set the totalPages value to inifinity. Yeah, it doesn't do that anymore; but you can still set the pager size to zero if you want!\n\n**Widgets**\n* Filter widget:\n  * Should now properly initialize when the pager plugin/widget is used with ajax and/or the `filter_serversideFiltering` option is `true`. Fixes [issue #388](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/388).\n  * Please note that the select dropdowns still sort using the natural sort algorithm, but since it is using the function directly, empty cells will not sort based on the `emptyTo` option. If this is a big problem, let me know!\n* Grouping widget:\n  * Added `group_callback` option - this sets a callback function which allows  modification of each group header label - like adding a subtotal for each group, or something. See the [updated demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-grouping.html).\n  * Added `group_complete` option which is `\"groupingComplete\"` by default. This is the name of the event that is triggered once the grouping widget has completed updating.\n* Updated the editable widget:\n  * Added `editable_editComplete` option which names the event that is triggered after tablesorter has completed updating the recent edit.\n  * You can also bind to the `change` event for that editable element, but it may occur before tablesorter has updated its internal data cache.\n* Storage\n  * The `$.tablesorter.storage()` function now has options including the `fixedUrl` option described in the core section above.\n  * Also added storage options which can be used for custom widgets: `$.tablesorter.storage(table, key, value, { url : 'mydomain', id : 'table-group' })`.\n  * Additionally, for already build-in widgets, you can apply data-attributes to the table: `<table class=\"tablesorter\" data-table-page=\"mydomain\" data-table-group=\"financial\">...</table>`.\n  * For more details, please see [issue #389](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/389).\n\n**Parsers**\n* Added an IPv6 parser\n  * This parser will auto-detect (the `is` function checks for valid IPv6 addresses).\n  * Added a new [IPv6 parser demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-ip-address.html).\n  * Included rather extensive unit tests for just this parser o.O.\n\n#### <a name=\"v2.11.1\">Version 2.11.1</a> (10/11/2013)\n\n* Fixed an updating bug:\n  * The pager was not updating properly\n  * The `updateComplete` event was not firing when not using ajax.\n  * Thanks @sbine for sharing the fix!\n\n#### <a name=\"v2.11\">Version 2.11</a> (10/10/2013)\n\n**Core**\n* Initialized widgets (widgets with options) are now tracked to ensure widget options are extended when using \"applyWidgets\". Fixes [issue #330](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/330).\n* An javascript error no longer pops up when setting the `delayInit` option to `true` and using the `saveSort` widget (or triggering a `sorton` method). Fixes [issue #346](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/346).\n* Only visible columns will be considered when fixing column widths. Fixes [issue #371](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/371).\n* Merged in fix for jQuery version check ([pull #338](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/338)). This also fixes [issue #379](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/379). Thanks @lemoinem!\n* Removed natural sort's ability to sort dates. This shouldn't be a problem since tablesorter uses parsers detect &amp; parse date columns automatically. Fixes [issue #373](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/373).\n* Fixed [issue #381](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/381).\n  * Any class name that is set by an option and is later used to search for that element now has an empty default class name.\n  * The reasoning is that if a developer adds two class names to the option, the jQuery find breaks.\n  * All default single class name options are now contained within `$.tablesorter.css`\n  * Options affected include: tableClass, cssAsc, cssDesc, cssHeader, cssIcon, cssHeaderRow, cssProcessing in the core.\n  * Note that the `cssIcon` option retains it's default class name &amp; functionality to not add an `<i>` inside the table cell if this *extra class name* is undefined.\n  * Widget options affected include: filter_cssFilter and stickyHeaders.\n* Removed `return false` from header mouse/keyboard interaction. Fixes [issue #305](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/305) &amp; [issue #366](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/366).\n\n**Parsers**\n* Fixed sugar date parser demo to point to the correct parser file and sugarjs resource.\n* General cleaned up date, fraction and metric parsers &amp; fixing of minor bugs.\n\n**Build Table Widget (new)**\n* Build a table starting with an assortment of data types ( array, text (CSV, HTML) or object (json) ).\n* This widget isn't really a widget because it is run and does it's processing before tablesorter has initialized; but the options for it are contained within the tablesorter `widgetOptions`.\n\n**Column Widget**\n* General cleanup\n\n**Filter Widget**\n* Exact matches can still be made if the user enters an exact match indicator twice (i.e. `John==` will still find `John` in the column; before it would think the user was looking for `John=` after the second `=` was typed)\n* Dynamically added filter reset buttons will now work automatically. Added by [pull #327](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/327). Thanks @riker09!\n* Chrome appears to have fixed the hidden input bug, so reverted changes to the basic filter demo. Fixes [issue #341](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/341).\n* The filter widget will work properly with sub-tables. Fixes [issue #354](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/354). Thanks @johngrogg!\n* Fixed issues with `filter_columnFilters` set to `false`. Fixes [issue #355](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/355).\n* Searches now have accents replaced if the `sortLocaleCompare` option is `true`. Fixes [issue #357](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/357).\n* Merged in enhancement for the filter widget & updated docs - add row to `filter_functions` parameters ([issue #367](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/367), [pull #368](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/368)). Thanks @gknights!\n* FilterFormatter jQuery UI Datepicker now includes the user selected time for comparisons. Thanks @TheSin-!\n* Another fix to the filteFormatter jQuery UI Datepicker to make it work properly with the sticky header widget. Thanks @TheSin-!\n* Removed filter_cssFilter default class name. The \"tablesorter-filter\" class name is automatically added, and this option now contains any additional class names to add. Fixes [issue #381](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/381).\n\n**Grouping Widget**\n* The grouping widget now works across multiple tbodies.\n* Added `group-false` header option which disables the grouping widget for a specific column. Fixes [issue #344](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/344).\n* Added the `group_collapsed` option which when true and the `group_collapsible` option is also true, all groups will start collapsed. Fulfills [issue #352](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/352).\n* You can now toggle *all* group rows by holding down the shift key while clicking on a group header.\n* This widget now works properly with the pager addon (pager addon updated). Fixes [issue #281](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/281).\n\n**StickyHeaders Widget**\n* Caption outerheight now used to get the correct full height of the caption. Thanks @TheSin-!\n* `stickyHeaders_zIndex` option added to allow users to customize their sticky header z-index. Fixes [issue #332](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/332). Thanks @TheSin-!\n\n**UITheme widget**\n* Updated Bootstrap theme to work with Bootstrap v3\n  * Only additions were made to the sorting icons class names within in the `$.tablesorter.themes.bootstrap` defaults (contained in the `jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js` file).\n  * So the theme will support all current versions of Bootstrap, just make sure you are using the appropriate icon class name (`icon-{name}` = v2; `glyphicon glyphicon-{name}` = v3).\n  * Removed the gradient background from the header &amp; footer cells.\n  * Added a reduced icon font side for header sort icons.\n  * Renamed the pager class from `pager` to `ts-pager` as Bootstrap adds a lot of padding to that class. See [Bootstrap theme demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-bootstrap-theme.html).\n  * Thanks @YeaYeah for sharing how to fix the top border in [issue #365](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/365).\n\n**Pager**\n* Fixed the `removeRows` option error when set to `true`.\n* The pager now stores any object returned by the `ajaxProcessing` function in `table.config.pager.ajaxData`\n  * The object should contain attributes for `total` (numeric), `headers` (array) and `rows` (array of arrays).\n  * A replacement `output` option can also be loaded via this method and must be included in the `output` attribute (i.e. `ajaxData.output`).\n  * Additional attributes are also available to the output display by using the attribute key wrapped in curly brackets (e.g. `{extra}` from `ajaxData.extra`).\n  * Additional attributes can also be objects or arrays and can be accessed via the output string as `{extra:0}` (for arrays) or `{extra:key}` for objects.\n  * The page number is processed first, so it would be possible to use this string `{extra:{page}}` (`{page}` is a one-based index), or if you need a different value use `{page+1}` (zero-based index plus any number), or `{page-1}` (zero-based index minus any number).\n  * For more details, please see [issue #326](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/326).\n  * Thanks @camallen for the suggestions &amp; feedback!\n* The \"updateComplete\" event should now properly trigger after an ansynchronous ajax call has completed. Fixes [issue #343](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/343).\n* Added a new `savePages` option\n  * Requires requires the `$.tablesorter.storage` script within the `jquery.tablesorter.widget.js` file to work properly.\n  * When `true`, it saves pager page & size if the storage script is loaded (requires $.tablesorter.storage in jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js).\n  * The pager will continue to function properly without the storage script, it just won't save the current page or pager size.\n  * Fulfills enhancement request from [issue #345](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/345).\n* Removed table update when using ajax with a server that is already doing all of the work. Fixes [issue #372](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/372) &amp; [issue #361](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/361). Thanks @sbine!\n* Merged in change to count table th length after ajaxProcessing ([pull #383](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/383)). Thanks @harryxu!\n* Reverted changes made in [pull #349](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/349) as the error row was not showing because the urls did not exactly equal each other.\n* Child rows within the pager will now properly display/hide. Fixes [issue #348](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/348).\n* Merged in fix for pager redundant ajax requests ([pull #336](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/336)). Thanks @camallen!\n* Merged in fix for pager totalRows check ([pull #324](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/324)). Thanks @camallen!\n\n**Internal fixes**\n* Modified the pager plugin internal variables to use `p` for pager options and `c` for table config options - for consistency.\n* Cleaned up the formatting of a few parsers (mostly cosmetic!)\n* Some parser functions were added to the `$.tablesorter` object instead of keeping them as private functions, just because my OCD compelled me to do it.\n* Some of the changes made the parsers are no longer backward compatible to the original version of tablesorter. Break away man, just do it!\n\n**Thanks**\n* Thanks to @thezoggy and @TheSin- for help maintaining and supporting the tablesorter github project while I was away!\n* Also thanks to everyone else that contributed and even more thanks to those that helped troubleshoot and solve problems!\n",
